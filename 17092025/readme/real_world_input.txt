## Where Does the Input Come From in the Real World?

In a real production environment, you wouldn't be manually running a script that generates errors. Instead, logs are constantly being generated by all your services and collected in a central log aggregation and monitoring system.

Your input for the MCP would typically come from one of these platforms:

    Datadog

    Splunk

    Grafana Loki

    Elasticsearch (ELK Stack)

    Google Cloud Logging / AWS CloudWatch

The typical workflow for an SRE would be:

    An alert fires (e.g., "High 5xx Error Rate on payment-service").

    The SRE opens their monitoring tool (like Datadog) and navigates to the logs for the payment-service around the time of the alert.

    They would see thousands of log lines. They would then filter for errors (level=error).

    From there, they would either:

        Copy a key snippet (like you're doing now with the examples) that clearly shows the error.

        Export the last 5 minutes of error logs into a .log or .txt file to capture the full context.

Your request to handle "raw full logs" is exactly what's needed to make this tool truly professional.

## How to Make the Input More Flexible

We can upgrade the Gradio UI to accept either a quick text paste or a full file upload. This requires changes to mcp_host_gradio.py and a small but important prompt enhancement in mcp_server.py.

Step 1: Update the Gradio UI (mcp_host_gradio.py)

This new interface will have both a textbox and a file upload component. It's smart enough to use the input from whichever one you provide.

mcp_host_gradio.py
Python

import gradio as gr
import requests
import json
import time
import os

MCP_SERVER_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:5001/analyze"

# Ensure a directory for reports exists
os.makedirs("reports", exist_ok=True)

def analyze_incident(incident_text: str, incident_file, analysis_level: str):
    """
    Handles both text and file input, sends it to the server, and streams the response.
    """
    # Start with empty/hidden components
    yield {
        output_report: "",
        download_button: gr.File(visible=False)
    }

    incident_log = ""
    # Prioritize file input if it exists
    if incident_file is not None:
        incident_log = incident_file.decode('utf-8')
    elif incident_text.strip():
        incident_log = incident_text
    else:
        yield {output_report: "Please enter an incident log snippet or upload a log file."}
        return
    
    payload = {
        "incident_description": incident_log,
        "analysis_level": analysis_level
    }
    
    full_response_text = ""
    try:
        # The rest of the streaming logic is the same
        response = requests.post(MCP_SERVER_URL, json=payload, stream=True, timeout=600) # Increased timeout for larger logs
        response.raise_for_status()
        
        for chunk in response.iter_content(chunk_size=None, decode_unicode=True):
            if "__END_OF_STREAM__" in chunk:
                parts = chunk.split("__END_OF_STREAM__\n")
                final_report_content = parts[1] if len(parts) > 1 else full_response_text
                
                if analysis_level == 'Full Report':
                    timestamp = time.strftime("%Y%m%d-%H%M%S")
                    report_filename = f"reports/mcp_report_{timestamp}.md"
                    with open(report_filename, "w", encoding='utf-8') as f:
                        f.write(final_report_content)
                    
                    yield {
                        output_report: full_response_text, 
                        download_button: gr.File(value=report_filename, visible=True, label="Download Report")
                    }
                break
            
            full_response_text += chunk
            yield {output_report: full_response_text}

    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        yield {output_report: f"Failed to connect to MCP server: {e}"}

]
analysis_options = ["RCA Only", "RCA + Remediation", "Full Report"]

with gr.Blocks(theme=gr.themes.Soft()) as demo:
    gr.Markdown("# ü§ñ MCP (Model Context Protocol): Platform for SRE")
    
    with gr.Row():
        with gr.Column(scale=2):
            gr.Markdown("### 1. Provide Incident Data")
            incident_input_text = gr.Textbox(
                label="Option A: Paste a Log Snippet",
                placeholder="Paste a key log line here...",
                lines=5
            )
            incident_input_file = gr.File(
                label="Option B: Upload a Raw Log File (.log, .txt)",
                file_types=['.log', '.txt']
            )
            
            gr.Markdown("### 2. Choose Analysis Depth")
            level_input = gr.Radio(
                choices=analysis_options,
                label="Analysis Level",
                value="Full Report"
            )
            
            analyze_button = gr.Button("üîç Analyze Incident", variant="primary")
            gr.Examples(examples=example_logs, inputs=incident_input_text, label="Example Snippets")

        with gr.Column(scale=3):
            gr.Markdown("### 3. Review Analysis")
            output_report = gr.Markdown(label="Live Analysis Output")
            download_button = gr.File(label="Download Full Report", visible=False)

    analyze_button.click(
        fn=analyze_incident,
        inputs=[incident_input_text, incident_input_file, level_input],
        outputs=[output_report, download_button]
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    demo.launch()

Step 2: Enhance the Server's RCA Task (mcp_server.py)

Your server code is already equipped to handle a larger string as input. However, we should make the RCA agent's instructions more robust so it knows how to handle a noisy log file instead of just a single line.

In mcp_server.py, find the rca_task definition and update its description to be smarter:

mcp_server.py (Update this one task definition)
Python

# ... inside the analyze function ...

            rca_task = Task(
                description=(
                    "Analyze the following incident log data to identify the primary error type. "
                    "The log may contain multiple entries; find the most critical pattern "
                    "(e.g., 'deadlock', 'exception', 'timeout', 'injection attempt'). "
                    "Once you identify the core ErrorType, use the Code Intelligence Graph Tool with that "
                    "ErrorType to find the root cause in the source code.\n\n"
                    f"Log Data:\n---\n{incident_description}\n---"
                ),
                expected_output="A detailed root cause analysis, citing the faulty functions and code.",
                agent=rca_agent
            )
# ... the rest of the file is the same ...

## Benefits of This Upgrade

    Real-World Ready: Your tool can now handle the kind of data an SRE would actually use during an incident.

    Handles Complexity: The agent is now instructed to intelligently search through potentially noisy logs to find the signal‚Äîthe key error message.

    Improved User Experience: The UI is cleaner and provides clear options for different types of input.

After making these changes, your MCP will be significantly more powerful and practical.
