Part 3: MCP Architecture with CrewAI & Code Intelligence Graph RAG

Here’s how to integrate this into your proposed MCP architecture.

Diagram of the Flow:
Code snippet

graph TD
    A[Logs from enhanced_ecommerce_runner.py] --> B{MCP Host};
    B -- "Incident: Deadlock Detected" --> C[1. Root Cause Analyser Agent];
    C -- "Query for deadlock causes" --> D(Tool: Code Intelligence Graph RAG);
    D -- "Returns `create_order` & `process_inventory_update` code" --> C;
    C -- "Root Cause: Inconsistent Lock Order" --> B;
    B -- "Passes Root Cause" --> E[2. Remediation Plan Agent];
    E -- "Analyze buggy code" --> D;
    D -- "Returns same functions" --> E;
    E -- "Plan: 'Standardize lock order in both functions'" --> B;
    B -- "Passes Cause & Plan" --> F[3. Report Writer Agent];
    F --> G[✅ Final Postmortem Report];

Workflow:

    Incident Trigger: Your enhanced_ecommerce_runner.py generates logs indicating a database_deadlock.

    Host Orchestration: The MCP Host ingests the logs and tasks the Root Cause Analyser Agent.

    Intelligent Retrieval: The RCA Agent uses its CodeIntelligenceGraphRAG tool. It queries the graph for functions linked to deadlocks and the orders and inventory tables.

    Precise Analysis: The tool returns the code for create_order and process_inventory_update. The agent analyzes this small, perfect context and identifies the inconsistent lock ordering.

    Remediation: The identified root cause is passed to the Remediation Plan Agent. It re-analyzes the code and suggests a concrete fix: "Refactor process_inventory_update to lock ORDERS before INVENTORY."

    Reporting: The Report Writer Agent receives the structured output from the previous two agents and compiles a comprehensive postmortem report, including the incident timeline, the precise root cause with code snippets, and the actionable remediation plan.

This architecture provides the "novel" element you need for your Master's project by creating a far more intelligent and effective RAG system tailored for the complexities of code analysis.
