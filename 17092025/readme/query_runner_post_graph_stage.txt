Excellent. Now that you have the "brain" (`code_intelligence_graph.graphml`), let's build the tool that your AI agents will use to query it.

This script, `query_graph.py`, implements the **Step 2: Retrieval** logic. It loads the graph and performs the precise, multi-hop queries needed to diagnose an incident. It's designed to be the "tool" that your Root Cause Analysis agent would call.

### The Graph Query and Retrieval Script

Here is the complete code for `query_graph.py`. It simulates exactly the scenario you described: investigating a `database_deadlock`.

**`query_graph.py`**

````python

"""
Code Intelligence Graph - Online Retrieval Tool

This script loads the pre-built code graph and provides functions to perform
multi-hop traversal queries to diagnose incidents. It simulates the process
an AI agent would use to find the root cause of an issue.

Scenario Simulated:
- Incident: A 'database_deadlock' is reported.
- Goal: Find the culpable functions, their source code, and construct a
  precise prompt for an LLM to perform the final analysis.

### How to Run It

1.  Save the code above as `query_graph.py`.
2.  Make sure the file generated by the previous step, `code_intelligence_graph.graphml`, is in the same directory.
3.  Run the script from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python query_graph.py
    ```

### Expected Output

When you run the script, it will print a detailed, step-by-step log of its investigation, culminating in the final, perfectly-formed prompt for your LLM agent.
